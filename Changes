          environment_vars_string_for()
        - PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT environment is added to disambiguate when
          PERL_MM_OPT, etc. was set by local::lib or other means

1.007000 2010-12-09
        - Chase the Module::Build version which supports PERL_MB_OPT. Thanks to
        miyagawa for pointing this out.

        - Split up method guess_shelltype from parts of print_environment_vars_for
        - Updated documentation about change of use with .modulebuildrc

        - Documented one method in all languages

        - Several minor fixes in the documentation
        - Changed methods look in documentation

        - Fixed newline in german translation from DOS2UNIX

1.006004 2010-06-10

        - I am stupid.

1.006003 2010-06-10

1.006002 2010-06-10

        - doc patch for win32 from run4flat
        - reverse the perl/arch paths in PERL5LIB

1.006000 2010-03-31

        - Create lib::core::only that provides the "set @INC to core dirs
          only" functionality that was the only part of --self-contained that
          ever worked usefully.
        - Delete broken --self-contained flag from core

1.005001 2010-03-10

        - I am an idiot.

1.005000 2010-03-10

        - More robust handling of running new toolchains on older perls. This
          should sort out issues users have with bootstrapping on e.g. Solaris
          and other traditional Unices. In addition, try to find a GNU tar
          capable of dealing with @LongLink so bootstrapping doesn't fail.

        - Warnings for missing PATH/PERL5LIB (as when not running interactively)
          silenced by a patch from Marco Emilio Poleggi.

        - Start of better docs for C<--self-contained> thanks to
          markstos@cpan.org.

1.004009 2009-11-07

        - Fix warning if your $ENV{PERL5LIB} is undef

        - Doc improvement from kgish/#perl-help@irc.perl.org

        - t0m and chrisa on #local-lib@irc.perl.org pointed out a PERL5LIB ordering issue
          with C<--self-contained>.

1.004008 2009-10-13

        - Clarify re-reading the shell config file after writing to it.

        - Clarify copyright and licensing for packaging by vendors.

1.004007 2009-09-02

        - Ensure that $ENV{PERL5LIB} and @INC are always de-duped, stopping
          them from growing if local::lib is invoked multiple times for the
          same path. (t0m)

        - Doc improvements by kurisuto@irc.perl.org/#catalyst.

        - Cleaned up indentation of code lines in the POD. Everything should be
          nice and flush, now.

1.004006 2009-08-25
        - Fix parsing of --self-contained and local lib directory. It's now
          possible to specify flags and the directory in any order. Also made
          adding future flags easier in the future. Thanks to
          frew@irc.perl.org/#catalyst for pointing out that --self-contained
          wouldn't work without a directory.

1.004005 2009-08-23
        - Add the --no-manpages option to bootstraping to tell EUMM / MB to not
          generate manpages from POD. Thanks to RKITOVER for providing the
          necessary values for CPAN.pm's configuration.

1.004004 2009-08-05

        - Add dependency on Extutils::Install 1.43 and install in --bootstrap
          otherwise we fail to build with latest MakeMaker on OpenSolaris (t0m)

        - Fix Win32 / Cygwin detection (emazep).

1.004003 2009-16-16
        - Stop Makefile.PL exploding if your CPAN is too old to have
          CPAN::HandleConfig. Needed when installing local::lib via CPAN
          using an old CPAN version (t0m)
        - Fix warning from Makefile.PL about ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt (t0m)
        - Set PERL5LIB back to calculated @INC with --self-contained, to stop
          invoking other perl scripts from losing the local::lib if they
          mangle @INC from $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and fix install of 'difficult'
          modules with such as Test::Deep (t0m)

1.004002 2009-06-15
        - Fixed up INC untaint procedure to skip/ignore CODE, ARRAY,
          blessed entries. (grink)
        - Include test in xt/ for the above

        - Put PERL5LIB first, so it'll be favored over privlibexp and
          archlibexp when self contained.
        - Automatically untaint @INC (t0m)
        - Prevent @INC from growing when you have multiple scripts using
          --self-contained called from inside one another. (grink by way of t0m)
        - eg/scripted_install.pl now no longer requires TARGET, but still
          respects it. (confound)

1.004001 2009-05-21
        - Clean up CPAN.pm's environment variable the same way we do for
          CPANPLUS. Add an example program showing local::lib employed
          programmatically (confound).

        - Add the beginnings of a troubleshooting section (pattern).

1.004000 2009-05-14
        - Don't allow dangerous settings for CPAN.pm that affect where CPAN
          installs stuff, as this conflicts with what we're trying to do.

        - Make sure that our Makefile is written to the correct directory when
          bootstrapping (confound).

1.003004 2009-05-12
        - Additional documentation and examples concerning having multiple
          local::lib enviornments (amiri)

        - Some install tests courtesy of Hans Dieter Pearcey <hdp@cpan.org>.
          Thanks!

1.003003 2009-04-09
        - Expose the internals per RT #36846.
        - Fix the MANIFEST up a bit.

1.003002 2009-02-25
        - Add a doc patch from Torsten Raudssus <torsten@raudssus.de> that
          clarifies how to specify a directory other than ~/perl5.

1.003001 2009-01-14
        - Properly bail if given fancy dashes obtained by copy-pasting from a
          UTF8-happy POD formatter. This will bail in both the Makefile.PL and
          in local::lib::import().

1.003000 2009-01-13
        - Add the --self-contained flag from Mark Stosberg, which also contains
          a doc patch warning about the dangers of UNINST=1. Thanks, Mark!

1.002000 2008-08-06
        - make CPAN config reinit non-prompting but still robust
        - make bootstrap auto-init CPAN config and set USE_DEFAULT for deps

1.001000 2007-09-19
        - refactored shell command generation
        - implemented C shell command generation based on this (checks $SHELL}
        - improved docs
        - modified Makefile.PL to install an up-to-date CPAN.pm if needed

1.000000 2007-09-13
        - initial release
