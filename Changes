 - I am an idiot.

1.005000 - 2010-03-10
 - More robust handling of running new toolchains on older perls. This
   should sort out issues users have with bootstrapping on e.g. Solaris

   same path. (t0m)
 - Doc improvements by kurisuto@irc.perl.org/#catalyst.
 - Cleaned up indentation of code lines in the POD. Everything should be
   nice and flush, now.

1.004006 - 2009-08-25
 - Fix parsing of --self-contained and local lib directory. It's now
   possible to specify flags and the directory in any order. Also made
   adding future flags easier in the future. Thanks to

   wouldn't work without a directory.

1.004005 - 2009-08-23
 - Add the --no-manpages option to bootstraping to tell EUMM / MB to not

   using an old CPAN version (t0m)
 - Fix warning from Makefile.PL about ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt (t0m)
 - Set PERL5LIB back to calculated @INC with --self-contained, to stop
   invoking other perl scripts from losing the local::lib if they
   mangle @INC from $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and fix install of 'difficult'
   modules with such as Test::Deep (t0m)

1.004002 - 2009-06-15
 - Fixed up INC untaint procedure to skip/ignore CODE, ARRAY,
   blessed entries. (grink)
 - Include test in xt/ for the above
 - Put PERL5LIB first, so it'll be favored over privlibexp and
   archlibexp when self contained.
 - Automatically untaint @INC (t0m)
 - Prevent @INC from growing when you have multiple scripts using
   --self-contained called from inside one another. (grink by way of t0m)
 - eg/scripted_install.pl now no longer requires TARGET, but still
   respects it. (confound)

1.004001 - 2009-05-21

   clarifies how to specify a directory other than ~/perl5.

1.003001 - 2009-01-14
 - Properly bail if given fancy dashes obtained by copy-pasting from a
   UTF8-happy POD formatter. This will bail in both the Makefile.PL and
   in local::lib::import().

1.003000 - 2009-01-13
 - Add the --self-contained flag from Mark Stosberg, which also contains
   a doc patch warning about the dangers of UNINST=1. Thanks, Mark!
