1.006000 - 2010-03-31

   only" functionality that was the only part of --self-contained that
   ever worked usefully.
 - Delete broken --self-contained flag from core

1.005001 - 2010-03-10
 - I am an idiot.

1.005000 - 2010-03-10
 - More robust handling of running new toolchains on older perls. This
   should sort out issues users have with bootstrapping on e.g. Solaris
   and other traditional Unices. In addition, try to find a GNU tar
   capable of dealing with @LongLink so bootstrapping doesn't fail.
 - Warnings for missing PATH/PERL5LIB (as when not running interactively)
   silenced by a patch from Marco Emilio Poleggi.
 - Start of better docs for C<--self-contained> thanks to
   markstos@cpan.org.

1.004009 - 2009-11-07
 - Fix warning if your $ENV{PERL5LIB} is undef
 - Doc improvement from kgish/#perl-help@irc.perl.org
 - t0m and chrisa on #local-lib@irc.perl.org pointed out a PERL5LIB ordering issue
   with C<--self-contained>.

1.004008 - 2009-10-13
 - Clarify re-reading the shell config file after writing to it.
 - Clarify copyright and licensing for packaging by vendors.

1.004007 - 2009-09-02
 - Ensure that $ENV{PERL5LIB} and @INC are always de-duped, stopping
   them from growing if local::lib is invoked multiple times for the
   same path. (t0m)
 - Doc improvements by kurisuto@irc.perl.org/#catalyst.
 - Cleaned up indentation of code lines in the POD. Everything should be
   nice and flush, now.

1.004006 - 2009-08-25
 - Fix parsing of --self-contained and local lib directory. It's now
   possible to specify flags and the directory in any order. Also made
   adding future flags easier in the future. Thanks to
   frew@irc.perl.org/#catalyst for pointing out that --self-contained
   wouldn't work without a directory.

1.004005 - 2009-08-23
 - Add the --no-manpages option to bootstraping to tell EUMM / MB to not
   generate manpages from POD. Thanks to RKITOVER for providing the
   necessary values for CPAN.pm's configuration.

1.004004 - 2009-08-05
 - Add dependency on Extutils::Install 1.43 and install in --bootstrap
   otherwise we fail to build with latest MakeMaker on OpenSolaris (t0m)
 - Fix Win32 / Cygwin detection (emazep).

1.004003 - 2009-16-16
 - Stop Makefile.PL exploding if your CPAN is too old to have
   CPAN::HandleConfig. Needed when installing local::lib via CPAN
   using an old CPAN version (t0m)
 - Fix warning from Makefile.PL about ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt (t0m)
 - Set PERL5LIB back to calculated @INC with --self-contained, to stop
   invoking other perl scripts from losing the local::lib if they
   mangle @INC from $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and fix install of 'difficult'
   modules with such as Test::Deep (t0m)

1.004002 - 2009-06-15
 - Fixed up INC untaint procedure to skip/ignore CODE, ARRAY,
   blessed entries. (grink)
 - Include test in xt/ for the above
 - Put PERL5LIB first, so it'll be favored over privlibexp and
   archlibexp when self contained.
 - Automatically untaint @INC (t0m)
 - Prevent @INC from growing when you have multiple scripts using
   --self-contained called from inside one another. (grink by way of t0m)
 - eg/scripted_install.pl now no longer requires TARGET, but still
   respects it. (confound)

1.004001 - 2009-05-21
 - Clean up CPAN.pm's environment variable the same way we do for
   CPANPLUS. Add an example program showing local::lib employed
   programmatically (confound).
 - Add the beginnings of a troubleshooting section (pattern).

1.004000 - 2009-05-14
 - Don't allow dangerous settings for CPAN.pm that affect where CPAN
   installs stuff, as this conflicts with what we're trying to do.
 - Make sure that our Makefile is written to the correct directory when
   bootstrapping (confound).

1.003004 - 2009-05-12
 - Additional documentation and examples concerning having multiple
   local::lib enviornments (amiri)
 - Some install tests courtesy of Hans Dieter Pearcey <hdp@cpan.org>.
   Thanks!

1.003003 - 2009-04-09
 - Expose the internals per RT #36846.
 - Fix the MANIFEST up a bit.

1.003002 - 2009-02-25
 - Add a doc patch from Torsten Raudssus <torsten@raudssus.de> that
   clarifies how to specify a directory other than ~/perl5.

1.003001 - 2009-01-14
 - Properly bail if given fancy dashes obtained by copy-pasting from a
   UTF8-happy POD formatter. This will bail in both the Makefile.PL and
   in local::lib::import().

1.003000 - 2009-01-13
 - Add the --self-contained flag from Mark Stosberg, which also contains
   a doc patch warning about the dangers of UNINST=1. Thanks, Mark!

1.002000 - 2008-08-06
 - make CPAN config reinit non-prompting but still robust
 - make bootstrap auto-init CPAN config and set USE_DEFAULT for deps
